# n-bodies-final

## Project Proposal

I would like to create a project that can produce video animations of certain physical phenomena. The first thing that comes to my mind is an n-body problem animation, where users can interact and set initial constraints for n-isolated bodies and then create an animation using python that would demonstrate how these bodies would move based on their initial conditions. This involves plugging the initial values into a differential equation and using numerical methods (e.g. Euler or Runge-Kutta) to solve for the paths over a certain time. This could be accompanied with concurrent plots showing the potential and kinetic energies of the bodies involved.


## To-Do / Execution

1. By the end of week 4, I will have all of the dependencies and packages I need for my project. I will do a little bit of research to refamiliarize myself with the numerical methods used to solve the physics problems. I will have an outline of the project architecture (i.e. user input, output, etc.)
2. By the end of week 5, I will hopefully implement the numerical solver to get the correct solution for a series of inputs. If not, hopefully it will be done for 2 and 3-body problems then I will scale up to larger ones
3. By the end of week 6, I will begin working on the animation aspect of the project. I think most of the coding will be done using the manim python library which is a package that helps create math animations. I will also find a way to measure the kinetic and potential energies of the bodies and implement them into the animation.
4. By the end of week 7, I will work on revising the visuals, making the animations look more smooth and to scale
5. By the end of week 8, I will test a simple user interface for user input and where the animation will display. I will optimize and run some animations to test.
6. Finally, I will write up some documentation and tidy up the project to make it a little more clean
